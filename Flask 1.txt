App routing in Flask refers to defining URL patterns and associating them with specific functions (view functions) in your Flask application. This is done using the @app.route decorator. 
App routes define how the application responds to different URLs.
Why do we use app routes:
URL Mapping: App routes allow you to map URLs to specific functions in your code. 
Modularity: App routing promotes a modular approach to building web applications.
Readability: By using decorators like @app.route, the code becomes more readable
